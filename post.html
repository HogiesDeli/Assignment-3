        <p>
            Every Tuesday night during the school year, we host a service called Tupos at 7pm in the Alumni Banquet
            Hall.
            Although we also call it <i>Church in a Box</i> because all of our gear is stored in a trailer.
            We have four different resource teams that come together to run everything and donate time each week so
            others
            can worship and listen to God's word.

                The Wesley Foundation has six resource teams. Create, Events, Guest Care, Prayer, Worship, and Maroon
                Platoon.
                Create, Worship, Prayer, and Guest Care fall under the "Core Four" resource teams, because each one
                plays a
                major part in helping out with Tupos.
                If one of these teams happend to drop the ball then something won't run like normal and could cause
                issues
                for another team.

            Each team starts at different times of the day with Create starting at 3pm with setting up lights, speakers,
            media booth, and other things.
            Worship team starts rehersing all of the songs for that night around 4:30 after they have all of their
            instruments and gear set up.
            The Prayer team meets for their meeting at 6:15 and then prays over the room at 6:30, while Guest Care start
            to
            greet and sign people in that are showing up.

            Overall Tupos each week lasts around 7 hours with setup, service, and teardown. All of us love it, and while
            at
            times it can be stressful if things aren't working like it should we still have fun and get to spend time
            with
            each other.
