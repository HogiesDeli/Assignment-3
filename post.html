            <p>
                Every Tuesday night during the school year, we host a service called Tupos at 7pm in the Alumni
                Banquet
                Hall.
                Although we also call it <i>Church in a Box</i> because all of our gear is stored in a trailer.
                We have four different resource teams that come together to run everything and donate time each week
                so
                others
                can worship and listen to God's word.
            </p>


            <p style="float:none;">
                Each team starts at different times of the day with Create starting at 3pm with setting up lights,
                speakers,
                media booth, and other things.
                Worship team starts rehersing all of the songs for that night around 4:30 after they have all of
                their
                instruments and gear set up.
                The Prayer team meets for their meeting at 6:15 and then prays over the room at 6:30, while Guest
                Care
                start
                to
                greet and sign people in that are showing up.

                Overall Tupos each week lasts around 7 hours with setup, service, and teardown. All of us love it,
                and
                while
                at
                times it can be stressful if things aren't working like it should we still have fun and get to spend
                time
                with
                each other.
            </p>

                    The Wesley Foundation has six resource teams. Create, Events, Guest Care, Prayer, Worship, and
                    Maroon
                    Platoon.
                    Create, Worship, Prayer, and Guest Care fall under the "Core Four" resource teams, because each one
                    plays a
                    major part in helping out with Tupos.
                    If one of these teams happend to drop the ball then something won't run like normal and could cause
                    issues
                    for another team.
