            <h3>Welcome to the WT Wesley Blog Page</h3>
            <p>
                Each and every blog or blurb here was created by members, alumni, staff, any anyone else who has come
                into
                our
                house. This is a place where we can all share our memories of crazy stuff that has happened or where we
                are
                in life.
                This site is almost like a library of each and every person's time at the Wesley and can be looked at
                for
                years to come.
            </p>

                        The WT Wesley is a community of passionate college students with a desire to see Christ grow in
                        their
                        lives,
                        hearts, and campus at West Texas A&M University. We worship together every Tuesday night at
                        Tupos
                        and
                        regularly
                        meet together in small groups to intentionally invest in each other and grow in our faith.
