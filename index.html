    <h3>Welcome to the WT Wesley Blog Page</h3>
    <main>
        <p>
            Each and every blog or blurb here was created by members, alumni, staff, any anyone else who has come into
            our
            house. This is a place where we can all share our memories of crazy stuff that has happened or where we are
            in life.
            This site is almost like a library of each and every person's time at the Wesley and can be looked at for
            years to come.

                The WT Wesley is a community of passionate college students with a desire to see Christ grow in their
                lives,
                hearts, and campus at West Texas A&M University. We worship together every Tuesday night at Tupos and
                regularly
                meet together in small groups to intentionally invest in each other and grow in our faith.
